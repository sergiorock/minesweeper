# MINESWIPPER API

API
* I created app on ruby on rails and postgres as database because I needed deploy on heroku.
* Due to I have better domain on "rails" I've created the views in ".erb" to ensure correct functionality in minor time.
* After checking correct functionality I proceed create the client.

Client
* I made the client with 'vuejs'
* I created a HTML file and add 'Vue' CDN to gain time instead create a new app.
* I added bootstrap CDN to use grid. And I add Axios CDN to make the ajax requests.
